)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame that's about to get some uninvited additions}

\item{add_totals}{Add a totals row (because someone needs to count everything)}

\item{add_empty}{Add empty rows (strategic breathing room)}

\item{add_header}{Add extra header rows (more titles = more important, right?)}

\item{seed}{Random seed for reproducible "improvements"}
}

A data frame with bonus content that nobody asked for
}
\description{
Because toddlers love to add their own special touches, this function
adds bonus rows that make about as much sense as a toddler's art project.
