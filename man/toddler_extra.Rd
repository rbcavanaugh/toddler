\title{Add extra rows like a toddler's "helpful" additions}
\usage{
toddler_extra(data, add_empty = TRUE, seed = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame that's about to get some uninvited additions}

\item{add_empty}{Add empty rows (strategic breathing room)}

\item{seed}{Random seed for reproducible "improvements"}
}
\value{
A data frame with bonus empty rows that nobody asked for
}
\description{
Because toddlers love to add their own special touches, this function
adds empty rows that make about as much sense as a toddler's art project.
(Note: Excel-style headers and totals removed to maintain R's rectangular data structure)

df <- data.frame(name = c("Alice", "Bob"), score = c(85, 92))
