\title{Add missing values like a toddler hiding their vegetables}
\usage{
toddler_missing(data, cols = names(data), prop = 0.1, seed = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame}

\item{cols}{Column names (character vector) or column indices to target.
Default is all columns because toddlers are indiscriminate in their chaos.}

\item{prop}{Proportion of missing values (0-1), single value or vector.
Can be different for each column, just like toddler preferences.}

\item{seed}{Random seed for reproducibility (because sometimes you need
the same mess twice)}
}
\value{
A data frame with strategically placed NAs
}
\description{
Introduces NAs into your data with the randomness of a toddler deciding
what they will and won't eat today.
}
\examples{
df <- data.frame(x = 1:10, y = letters[1:10])
toddler_missing(df, prop = 0.2)  # 20\% chaos
toddler_missing(df, cols = "x", prop = 0.5)  # Target specific columns
}
