\title{Mess up column names like a toddler with a label maker}
\usage{
toddler_names(data, style = "mixed", seed = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame with perfectly reasonable column names}

\item{style}{Type of messiness: "mixed" (random chaos), "title" (Title Case With Spaces),
"upper" (SHOUTY), or "lower" (whisper quiet)}

\item{seed}{Random seed for reproducible mess}
}
\value{
A data frame where column names have lost all sense of consistency
}
\description{
Takes your sensible naming conventions (snake_case, camelCase, etc.) and turns
them into a typographic disaster that looks like a toddler got hold of the Shift key.
}
\examples{
df <- data.frame(first_name = "Alice", lastName = "Smith", age_years = 25)
toddler_names(df, style = "mixed")  # Maximum chaos
toddler_names(df, style = "title")  # "First Name", "Last Name", "Age Years"
}
