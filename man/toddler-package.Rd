\title{toddler: Base R Functions to Mess Up Clean Data for Teaching}
\description{
A collection of functions that introduce common data quality issues into clean datasets, designed for teaching data cleaning and validation. Like a toddler with a crayon, these functions will gleefully mess up your perfectly organized data in educationally valuable ways. Includes functions to add missing values, duplicate rows, inconsistent formatting, mixed data types, and structural problems that mirror real-world data challenges.

\details{
The toddler package provides functions to systematically introduce realistic
data quality problems:

\strong{Structural Problems:}
\itemize{
\item \code{\link{toddler_wide}} - Convert tidy data to wide format
\item \code{\link{toddler_unjoin}} - Split data into multiple pieces
\item \code{\link{toddler_extra}} - Add unwanted header and summary rows
}

\strong{Formatting Issues:}
\itemize{
\item \code{\link{toddler_names}} - Mess up column name consistency
\item \code{\link{toddler_whitespace}} - Add random leading/trailing spaces
\item \code{\link{toddler_inconsistent}} - Make categorical values inconsistent
}

\strong{Data Type Problems:}
\itemize{
\item \code{\link{toddler_types}} - Mix text values into numeric columns
\item \code{\link{toddler_units}} - Add unit suffixes to numbers
}

\strong{Completeness Issues:}
\itemize{
\item \code{\link{toddler_missing}} - Introduce missing values (NAs)
\item \code{\link{toddler_duplicate}} - Add duplicate rows
}

All functions are pipe-friendly and work with base R, requiring no additional
dependencies beyond base R.

\section{Package philosophy}{

Real-world data is messy. Students learn data cleaning best when they work
with realistic problems rather than artificially clean datasets. This package
helps educators create datasets that mirror the chaos students will encounter
in practice.
