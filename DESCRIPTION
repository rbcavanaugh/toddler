Description: A collection of functions that introduce common data quality issues 
    into clean datasets, designed for teaching data cleaning and validation. 
    Like a toddler with a crayon, these functions will gleefully mess up your 
    perfectly organized data in educationally valuable ways. Includes functions 
    to add missing values, duplicate rows, inconsistent formatting, mixed data 
    types, and structural problems that mirror real-world data challenges.
